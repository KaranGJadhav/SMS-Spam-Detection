# SMS-Spam-Detection
Project is all about predecting the incoming message or mail to be a spam or not a spam.
This project explains the concept of Natural Language Processing.
I have used different NLP techniques for text understanding and pre-processsing and making the dataset ready for model building and analysis.

This project uses the below concepts for text processsing.
Tokenization
Vectorization
Feature extraction techniques such as "Bag of Words".
TDIDF techniques for deciding the importance of the words and reduce the length of Sparse vector. 
Naive Bayes algorithm technique for prediction and analysis.
